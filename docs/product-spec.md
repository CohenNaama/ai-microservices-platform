# AI-Powered Microservices Platform – Product Specification

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

**AI-Powered Microservices Platform** is a modular, distributed, and scalable system that processes user-submitted text using multiple intelligent microservices, including summarization, sentiment analysis, and smart tagging.

The system is built with a microservices architecture to promote high availability, horizontal scalability, and service decoupling. Communication is handled asynchronously using Kafka, and services are secured with modern authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## 🌍 Target Audience

- Employers looking to evaluate backend development, infrastructure, and system design skills
- Developers and engineers exploring text-processing pipelines
- Businesses interested in NLP-powered backend systems

---

## 💡 System Objectives

- Demonstrate real-world architecture using **Kafka**, **Redis**, **PostgreSQL**, **Docker**, and **FastAPI**
- Implement and orchestrate **multiple AI services** within a distributed system
- Apply professional **DevOps, CI/CD, security, and monitoring practices**
- Showcase scalability, modularity, and fault tolerance
- Ensure security using **JWT**, **OAuth2**, **RBAC**, **Rate Limiting**, and **WAF**

## 🔁 System Flow (High-Level)

1. A user submits a text via API (protected with JWT).
2. The `Text Receiver` validates and pushes the text to Kafka.
3. Three consumer services pick up the message from Kafka:
   - `Summarizer`: generates a short summary
   - `Sentiment Analyzer`: scores sentiment
   - `Tag Generator`: extracts key tags
4. `Aggregator` merges results into a structured JSON.
5. `Notifier` saves the result and notifies the user.
6. `Dashboard` displays data and system status in real time.

## 🔒 Security & Compliance

- ✅ JWT-based Authentication with Refresh Token flow
- ✅ OAuth2 login (Google/GitHub)
- ✅ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- ✅ Rate Limiting using Redis (Token Bucket strategy)
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization (Pydantic)
- ✅ HTTPS (Traefik reverse proxy or Nginx TLS)
- ✅ Web Application Firewall (WAF rules)
- ✅ Audit logging (who did what, when)
- ✅ Secrets encrypted and managed via `.env` or Vault
- ✅ Static security scans (Bandit / OWASP ZAP)

## ⚠️ Potential Risks & Mitigation

| Risk                    | Mitigation Strategy                                |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
